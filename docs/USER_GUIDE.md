## Getting Started

### What You Need
- A CSV file with your data
- Basic understanding of what clustering analysis is
- No programming knowledge required!

### What This Tool Does
The Cluster Interpretation Tool automatically:
- Cleans and prepares your data
- Finds the optimal number of clusters
- Groups similar data points together
- Explains what makes each cluster unique
- Provides visualizations to understand your data

## Uploading Your Data

### Supported File Format
- **CSV files only** (.csv extension)
- Your data should be in a table format with rows and columns

### Data Requirements
- **At least 2 columns** (features to analyze)
- **At least 10 rows** (data points to cluster)
- **Mixed data types supported**: numbers, text, categories
- **Missing values**: The tool will handle them automatically

### How to Upload
1. Click the "Browse files" button in the file uploader
2. Select your CSV file
3. The tool will automatically load and preview your data


## Understanding the Settings

### Target Column (Optional)
- **What it is**: A column you want to exclude from clustering analysis
- **When to use**: If you have a target variable (like "price" or "category") that you don't want to influence the clustering
- **Example**: If clustering customers, you might exclude "customer_id" as the target

### Scaling Method
- **MinMax**: Scales all features to range [0,1] - good for most cases
- **Standard**: Centers data around 0 with standard deviation 1 - good for normally distributed data
- **None**: No scaling - use only if your data is already on similar scales

### 2D Embedding Method
- **PCA**: Principal Component Analysis - faster, good for linear relationships
- **UMAP**: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection - better for complex patterns, slower

### Outlier Detection
- **Isolation Forest**: Automatically removes unusual data points that might skew results
- **None**: Keeps all data points (use if you want to preserve all data)

### Outlier Contamination
- **Range**: 1% to 10% of your data
- **Default**: 3% (removes the 3% most unusual points)
- **Higher values**: More aggressive outlier removal

### Clustering Range
- **Min clusters**: Minimum number of groups to try (default: 2)
- **Max clusters**: Maximum number of groups to try (default: 8)
- **Recommendation**: Start with 2-8, adjust based on your domain knowledge

## Preprocessing Your Data

### When Preprocessing is Available
The "Preprocess Data" button appears only when outlier detection is enabled (not "none").

### What Preprocessing Does
1. **Loads your data** from the CSV file
2. **Handles missing values** automatically
3. **Encodes categorical variables** (converts text to numbers)
4. **Scales numerical features** according to your chosen method
5. **Removes outliers** (if enabled)
6. **Prepares data** for clustering

### Understanding the Preprocessing Summary
After preprocessing, you'll see:
- **Original Shape**: How many rows and columns you started with
- **Final Shape**: How many rows and columns after preprocessing
- **Outliers Removed**: Number of unusual data points removed
- **Categorical Features Encoded**: Number of text columns converted to numbers

### Data Distribution Visualization
- Shows histograms of your features after preprocessing
- Helps you understand the distribution of your data
- Useful for identifying patterns or issues

## Running Clustering Analysis

### When You Can Run Clustering
- **With preprocessing**: After clicking "Preprocess Data" (when outlier detection enabled)
- **Without preprocessing**: Immediately when outlier detection is "none"

### What Happens During Clustering
1. **Feature Selection**: Chooses which columns to use for clustering
2. **2D Visualization**: Creates a 2D plot of your data
3. **Optimal K Selection**: Tests different numbers of clusters and picks the best one
4. **Final Clustering**: Groups your data into the optimal number of clusters
5. **Feature Analysis**: Analyzes what makes each cluster unique

### Understanding the Plots

#### 1. Embedding Plot
- Shows your data in 2D space
- Each point represents one row from your data
- Points closer together are more similar

#### 2. Model Selection Plot
- **Blue line**: Shows how well different numbers of clusters work
- **Orange line**: Shows how distinct the clusters are
- **Peaks**: Indicate good numbers of clusters
- **Elbow**: Where the blue line bends sharply

#### 3. Final Clustering Plot
- Shows your data colored by cluster
- Each color represents a different group
- Helps visualize how well the clustering worked

#### 4. Feature Distribution Plots
- Shows how each feature varies across clusters
- Box plots show the distribution of values
- Helps identify what makes each cluster unique

## Interpreting Results

### Cluster Summaries
The tool automatically generates descriptions like:
- "Cluster 0 has high values for feature X and low values for feature Y"
- "Cluster 1 is characterized by moderate values across all features"

### Understanding Cluster Characteristics
- **High values**: This cluster has above-average values for this feature
- **Low values**: This cluster has below-average values for this feature
- **Moderate values**: This cluster has average values for this feature

### Driver Features Table
- Shows the most important features for each cluster
- Higher scores mean the feature is more important for that cluster
- Helps you understand what defines each group

## Downloading Results

### What You Can Download
- **Cluster Assignments**: A CSV file with your original data plus a "Cluster" column
- **Format**: Each row shows which cluster that data point belongs to

### How to Use the Downloaded File
1. Open in Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet program
2. The "Cluster" column shows which group each row belongs to
3. Use this for further analysis, reporting, or business decisions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "File upload failed"
- **Solution**: Make sure your file is a CSV format
- **Check**: File extension should be .csv

#### "No clusters found"
- **Solution**: Try increasing the maximum number of clusters
- **Check**: Make sure you have enough data (at least 10 rows)

#### "Preprocessing failed"
- **Solution**: Check your data for extreme values or formatting issues
- **Try**: Reducing outlier contamination or disabling outlier detection

#### "Clustering is slow"
- **Solution**: Try PCA instead of UMAP for embedding
- **Check**: Reduce the maximum number of clusters to try

### Data Quality Tips
- **Clean your data** before uploading (remove obvious errors)
- **Check for missing values** and fill them if possible
- **Remove irrelevant columns** (like IDs or timestamps)
- **Ensure consistent formatting** (same date format, number format, etc.)

### Performance Tips
- **Start with smaller datasets** to test the tool
- **Use PCA embedding** for faster results
- **Limit clustering range** (e.g., 2-6 clusters instead of 2-15)
- **Disable outlier detection** if you want to keep all data

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered in this guide:
1. Check the data format and quality
2. Try different settings combinations
3. Start with a smaller subset of your data
4. Ensure your data meets the minimum requirements
